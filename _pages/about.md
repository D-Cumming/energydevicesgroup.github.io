Electrochemical devices such as batteries and fuel cells will play a pivotal role across society, in particular, in regards to the decarbonization of the energy and transport systems across the globe. Proper device function is not possible without a multiscale understanding of the electrode, interface structure, and the development of a manufacturing processes to enable device fabrication.

My research takes place at the interface between materials and manufacturing, encompassing a wide range of oxides and other functional materials. Current applications include electrodes for electrochemical devices, such as batteries, fuel cells and sensors. And to develop new ways to digitally design and build electrodes and device assemblies 

Our current challenge is on how to design new types of battery electrode structures, quantify their behaviour and probe the fundamental processes that govern their operation and the processes used to make them. This involves material and process development as well as in-situ and operando techniques to investigate changes in morphology and function.
